## About
I worked in the oilfield as a drilling fluids engineer for 9+ years. Every location I have worked has been remote and the climate is often 
extreme (North Dakota in the winter). Inventory management is one of the more unpleasant tasks to do in sub zero weather. I would have to go around location 
and count all products on location daily with a pen and paper. I would then have to bring that inventory count back to a computer to input it into a daily report. 
This was tedious, repetitive, and error prone. The Oyloe Inventory Management system allows workers to input daily inventory counts directly through an app on their
smart phone or tablet. This eliminates potential errors from transferring counts from a tally book to a computer for report purposes. Now the reports can be 
generated directly on the device. OIMS also allows incoming product deliveries to be added through the app so that all inventory management processes are controlled in one convenient location.

## App Features
### Login to Account
User account will be generated by company IT department for security purposes. On login screen, users are directed to input their username and password to be
given access to their site's inventory information. Clicking the login button will direct user to the app home screen where they can create new delivery tickets or input their daily inventory.

### Start a New Delivery Ticket
User can click on "Input New Delivery" to create a new ticket when products are delivered to location. This will bring them to a ticket generator where they can add
the delivered products with the quantity and it will populate the new ticket with their products. Once all products have been added, the ticket can be submitted by clicking "Submit Delivery Ticket". This will return the user the Home screen.

### Input Daily Inventory
User can click on "Input Daily Inventory" to load the inventory screen. On this screen, all products currently on location will be listed with their name, a short description, and the quantity from the previous day. User can input inventory quantities on each product card to update the current quantity available on location. Once all product quantity changes have been entered, user can hit "Submit Daily Inventory" to submit inventory changes.

## Challenges
Implementing Typescript for the first time was difficult. I had to develop custom data types for all of the product info that was being fetched from my back end. I found the documentation for Typescript to be extremely helpful in determining the best way to implement my custom typing. Coming from React to React Native also brought some unique styling challenges. Styling for a mobile device requires a different approach then in browser style. I was able to use a great styling library called React Native Elements to implement my design.

## Future Implementation
 - User can add custom products directly to delivery tickets for abnormal deliveries
 - User can be tied to more than one inventory to manage multiple locations from one account
 - Product quantity changes will be optimistically rendered on inventory screen

 ## Collaboration
 1. Fork and clone this repo along with backend repo https://github.com/boyloe/Oyloe-Inventory-Management-backend
 2. Install back and frontend dependencies with `npm install`
 3. Create new database `siteInventory` on backend by opening mongoShell and typing `use siteInventory`
 4. Run `npm start` on frontend to get the expo server running
 5. To run on iOS emulator, Xcode must be installed, for android use Android Studio to create a virtual machine. Full documentation is available in Expo docs.
